# C2: a clean rewrite of Collusion

Refactoring to have a suite of reusable components.

The README.md should answer common questions like:

* What does your software do? Is it an application? A library?
* Links through to important sections of the wiki. Like installation instructions
* How do I contribute code? Link to contributors file
* Where is the community around this software? List IRC channels, mailing lists, issue trackers, code repositories, etc.
